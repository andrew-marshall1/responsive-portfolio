                That is one of my favorites pictures that was taken this summer. My son Archer, who just turned 3 was having fun on the dance floor at my sister's wedding. He is an important part of my life and brings a lot of joy and happiness to my wife Meridith and me.

                We have lived in Colorado for close to 5 years and are orginally from Iowa. My wife and I have been married 10 years now and orginally met in high school. We both attended Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. There I got a degree in marketing and have been doind sales in one form or another ever since.

                I am a huge sports fan and enjoy just about every sport out there. Sports have been a huge part of my life and I have worked in the industry for several years prior to my son being born. I have spent the most time working in minor league baseball. The two teams I have worked for were the Omaha StormChasers and the Trenton Thunder. I have also worked in lacrosse with the Colorado Mammoth.

                Some of the activies I enjoy in my spare time involve anything with my son. My family alos tries to get out hiking on a regular basis. We all enjoy being outside as much as possible. I also enjoy doing various projects around the house. For example, I built our dinning room table and have also built cornhole boards as well.
